# ionbot workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how ionbot leverages MS²PIP and DeepLC predictions of peptide LC-MS behavior to sensitively identify (modified) peptides. First, you will learn how the machine learning tools MS²PIP and DeepLC accurately predict peptide fragmentation spectra and chromatography retention time. Then, you will see how to process proteomics data
with the [ionbot.cloud](https://ionbot.cloud) search engine. Finally, you will look into the open-modification search results of ionbot and see how predicted information can help to drastically reduce ambiguity between peptidoforms.


## Overview

The workshop exists out of three parts, each with an interactive Jupyter
notebook:

## Getting started

If you are used to working with Jupyter notebooks, you can download or clone
the repository and work locally. Otherwise, the easiest option to get started
is by using Google Colab:

1. If still required, sign into Google at `https://myaccount.google.com/`
2. If you have not worked with Jupyter / Colab notebooks yet, checkout the [short Colab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb)
2. Click the "Open in Colab" in hte table above for the notebook you want to open and get started!
